          certificates in the path after this certificate before an explicit policy
          is required for the rest of the path. When an explicit policy is required,
          each subsequent certificate in the path must contain a required policy OID,
          or a policy OID which has been declared as equivalent through the policy
          mapping extension.

          When parsing a certificate, a positive non-zero RequireExplicitPolicy
          means that the field was specified, -1 means it was unset, and
          RequireExplicitPolicyZero being true mean that the field was explicitly
          set to zero. The case of RequireExplicitPolicy==0 with
          RequireExplicitPolicyZero==false should be treated equivalent to -1
          (unset).
        type: integer
      requireExplicitPolicyZero:
        description: |-
          RequireExplicitPolicyZero indicates that RequireExplicitPolicy==0 should be
          interpreted as an actual maximum path length of zero. Otherwise, that
          combination is interpreted as InhibitAnyPolicy not being set.

          library which understands all the critical extensions.

          Users can access these extensions using Extensions and can remove
          elements from this slice if they believe that they have been
          handled.
